A student should be able to take a quiz online. The quiz includes different types of question and each
question has a unique correct answer. During the quiz a student is promoted with a question (one at a
time) and a way to provide the answer. After each response, the system should provide a feedback to
the student weather he/she answered the question correctly or not, before the next question appears.
During the quiz, a scoreboard should keep track and display the number of questions answered so
far, and the total score. At the end of the quiz, the student you receive a message saying "You pass
the quiz" if he scores 80% or above and the message saying "You fail the quiz".Moreover, at the end
of the quiz the student should be given the option to re-take the quiz.
