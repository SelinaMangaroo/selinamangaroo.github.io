            <div class=""><h2><strong>Neurocognitive Research Lab</strong></h2><p>The Neurocognitive Research Lab (NRL) was established in 2008 and is lead by
              Dr. Fofi Constantinidou. Researchers at the NRL investigate clinical populations such as patients with epilepsy, traumatic brain
              injury, healthy and pathological ageing exhibiting neuropsychological deficits using neuroscience and neurobehavioral research
              methodologies. The lab focuses on the development and application of assessment and treatment tools for patients with acquired
              cognitive deficits and investigates the effects of hierarchical intense neurocognitive training in patients with mild cognitive
              impairment and in patients with moderate-severe brain injury.
              <br>
              <br>
              Furthermore, the team manages the first longitudinal study in Cyprus
              on ageing aiming to identify the predictors for healthy and pathological cognitive ageing. Other studies include the exploration
              of stimulus modality preferences in pediatric patients with benign rolandic epilepsy and in adults with chronic temporal lobe
              epilepsy in an effort to determine the long-term effects of the condition and methods for maximizing sensory input to facilitate
              memory. Recently, we began a project investigating the relationship between brain structure and memory, executive functioning,
              and speed of processing abilities in patients with chronic brain injuries.</p>

          <div class=""><h2><strong>Clinical Psychology and Psychophysiology Lab​</strong></h2><p>The Clinical Psychology
            and Psychophysiology Lab is led by Dr. Georgia Panagiotou and studies emotion processes and emotion regulation and coping in
            psychopathology. Its aims are compatible with trans-diagnostic conceptualizations of psychopathology, focusing on the multi-method
            examination of basic brain systems involved in the etiology of disorders, including valence, arousal and executive function.
            <br>
            <br>
            A main focus is anxiety and fear and how different levels of these emotions predict different behavioral outcomes and symptoms. In this
            context lab personnel studies how children who display diverse aggressive profiles differ in defensive motivation, and how different
            anxiety disorders vary in the degree to which they are characterized by fear versus general negative affect. Interactions between emotion
            and cognition (attention, inhibition) and personality are also addressed. We also examine how dysfunctional emotion
            regulation, e.g. avoidance and attention deployment, perpetuate psychopathology. We use psychophysiology to assess emotion, especially
            the startle reflex, autonomic physiology and facial EMG, and various paradigms to induce emotion, such as imagery, VR, pictures and films
            and aim to verify our findings regarding individual difference in emotion and motivation using neuroimaging techniques.</p>

            <div class=""><h2><strong>Learning Disabilities Group</strong></h2><p>The Learning Disabilities (LD) group is lead by Dr. Timothy Papadopoulos and
              focuses on (a) the conceptualization and measurement of various constructs related to reading, language performance, and intelligence,
              (b) the study of the developmental markers in prevalent pediatric disorders such as reading difficulties and dyslexia, Attention
              Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Specific Language Impairment, and (c) the differential diagnosis and treatment for these disorders.
              <br>
              <br>
              In doing so, the LD group (1) has established the reliability and construct validity of major cognitive and linguistic batteries in
              order to reliably assess the various cognitive, linguistic, and neuropsychological skills that are related to the identification of
              Specific Learning Disorders (SLD), (2) investigates the possible neurological basis of children with language and reading disabilities
              through the use of eye-tracking and electrophysiological (event-related potentials; ERP) methodologies, (3) examines the relationship
              between fluid intelligence and language ability by recording the ERPs of childhood populations varying in age and ability, and (d)
              develops and tests different intervention strategies across individual cases.</p>

            <div class=""><h2><strong>Language and Cognitive Development Research Group</strong></h2><p>The Language and Cognitive Development Research Group is
              led by Dr. George Spanoudis and encompasses wide expertise in areas including language development and understanding, and cognitive
              development in typical and atypical populations. Our work bridges ideas and methods generated within developmental, cognitive and
              differential psychology.
              <br>
              <br>
              The primary focus of the group is to explore the neural bases of language and cognitive development from 4-18 years of age, combining
              cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive research with neural imaging (EEG/ERPs) to study typical and atypical cognitive and language
              development. Our research program is extended on issues of language processing and learning, theory of mind development, and cognitive
              correlates of developing intelligence. The group has developed new theoretical models of cognitive development and relates them with
              evidence coming from neuroimaging data.</p>
